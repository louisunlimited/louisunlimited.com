#### What is pnpm?

<u>[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)</u> is a fast, disk space efficient package manager, better than npm! 
<br/>

#### Why did I switch from npm to pnpm?
Though I don't really have an issue working with npm, I always hoped that there would be a better package manager out there that provides a much better DX (Developer Experience). And I think pnpm is the one that I've been looking for.
<br />
__Some of the reasons why I switched from npm to pnpm are:__
 - pnpm is faster than npm
 - pnpm is disk space efficient (very important for me!!)

<br/>

pnpm uses symbolic links to link packages to the node_modules folder. This means that if, for example, two of your dependencies share the same package C, pnpm will make sure that only one copy of C is installed. Rather than downloading it twice like what npm does. This is the main reason for why pnpm is disk space efficient.

<br/>

#### How to migrate from npm to pnpm?

It's actually pretty easy to migrate from npm to pnpm. Follow these steps to get started:

- Install pnpm
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
or
brew install pnpm
or
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```
<br/>

- Remove node_modules
```bash
npx npkill // if you have npx installed
or
rm -rf node_modules
```
<br/>

- Run
```bash
pnpm import
```
This will create a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in your project directory based on your `packages-lock.json` file.
<br/>
So now it's safe to delete your `package-lock.json` file.

- Remove package-lock.json
```bash
rm package-lock.json
```

<br/>

- And Finally
```bash
pnpm install
```
<br/>
##### Congratulations! You have successfully migrated from npm to pnpm! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
<br/>
Now you can try `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run build` to see if everything works as expected.
<br/>
Optionally, you can add a `.npmrc` file to your project directory for custom configurations. For example, you can add this line to your `.npmrc` file to make sure your depenency peers are automatically installed.
```bash
auto-install-peers=true
```
