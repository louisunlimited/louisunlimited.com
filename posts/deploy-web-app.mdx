#### Inroduction

Next.js has became one of my favourite frameworks when it comes to big production apps. It's fast, easy to use and has a lot of great features. 

If you are building a responsive app, you might want to test it on multiple devices, your phone, your tablet, your laptop, etc; 
and the chrome dev tools are often just not good enough, it can't really give you a good idea of how your app will look and feel like on a real device can it?

Also, if you want to test browser support and system support, often times you will need to test it on a real device or inside a virtual machine, all of which cannot share the same localhost as you ran `pnpm run dev`

You might've already know some of the solutions like using [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) or else, while they are indeed super good tools, but they seems a bit overkill for this and I only wanted to test only local network devices.

#### Solution

After some digging, it turns out that you can use your local ip address to access your localhost on other devices.

To start, you will need to find what local ip is your WIFI router using.

You can do this by running `ipconfig` on windows or `ifconfig` on mac.

You should see something like this:

```bash
lo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384
    options=1203<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TXSTATUS,SW_TIMESTAMP>
    inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1
    ...
    status: active
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
    ether 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet6 fe80::0000:0000:0000:0000%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x4
    inet 192.1xx.x.x netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast
    ...
    status: active
``` 

Mostlikely, the ip address you are looking for is the one under `inet` for `en0` or `en1` or else. In the above example, it's `192.1xx.x.x`

##### If you don't have prior knowledge on this and you have trouble locating the ip address used for your wifi router, try the following command:

```bash
$ networksetup -listallhardwareports
```

You should see something like this along the lines:

```bash
Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en0
Ethernet Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

Now you know your local WIFI is using `en0` as the device, you can run the following command to get the ip address for `en0`:

```bash
$ ifconfig en0
```

or goback to the first method and run `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` to find the ip address under `inet` for `en0`.

#### Result

Now, you can run `pnpm run dev -H 192.1xx.x.x` or `npm run dev -H 192.1xx.x.x` to start your app on your local ip address and access the app on anyother server in the same network by going to `192.1xx.x.x:3000`.

You may also apply optional ports after the ip address, for example, `pnpm run dev -H 192.1xx.x.x -p 1234` to access the app on port 1234.
